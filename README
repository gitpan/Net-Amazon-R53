    December 26, 2012 as part of Net-Amazon-R53.

SYNOPSIS
        use Net::Amazon::R53;

        my $r53 = Net::Amazon::R53->new(id => $aws_id, key => $aws_key);

        $r53
            ->get_hosted_zone('Z1345....')

            ->delete
            ;

        # ...etc.

DESCRIPTION
    This is an interface to Amazon's Route53 DNS service. It aims to be
    simple, reliable, well tested, easily extensible, and capable of
    rescuing kittens from volcanoes.

    Well, maybe not that last part.

REQUIRED ATTRIBUTES
    These attributes are required, and must have their values supplied
    during object construction.

  id
    Your AWS id.

  key
    ...and the corresponding AWS secret key.

LAZY ATTRIBUTES
    These attributes are lazily constructed from another source (e.g.
    required attributes, external source, a BUILD() method, or some combo
    thereof). You can set these values at construction time, though this is
    generally neither required nor recommended.

  signer
    The logic that authenticates your requests to Route53.

ATTRIBUTES
  hosted_zones_hash
    Contains a list of all "HostedZones" associated with this AWS key/id;
    lazily built. Right now we fetch at most 100 records.

  template_dir
    The directory we expect to find our templates in.

METHODS
  signed_headers
    Returns a list of headers (key/value pairs) suitable for direct
    inclusion in the headers of a Route53 request.

  has_fetched_hosted_zones
    True if the "hosted_zones" attribute is currently populated (that is,
    we've fetched some at some point from Amazon.

  clear_hosted_zones
    Deletes our cached set of hosted zones, if we have any.

  has_hosted_zones
    True if we currently have any hosted zones.

  has_hosted_zone($plain_id)
    True if we have a zone with a plain id as passed to us.

  hosted_zone_ids
    Returns all of the hosted zone ids we know about.

  hosted_zones
    Returns a list of all known hosted zones; that is, a list of
    Net::Amazon::R53::HostedZone instances.

  hosted_zones_count
    Returns the number of hosted zones Route53 thinks we have. =method
    hosted_zone_by_id($id)

    Looks for a hosted zone with the passed value as its id. Note that we're
    talking about the so-called "plain" id, not the fully qualified one
    (e.g. 'Z12345', not '/hostedzone/Z12345').

  hosted_zone_by_caller_reference($caller_reference)
    Looks for a zone with the passed string as its caller reference. Returns
    nothing if no such zone is found.

  get_resource_record_sets(<hosted zone id>)
    Given a hosted zone id, we fetch all its associated resource record
    sets.

  create_hosted_zone(name => ..., caller_reference => ..., comment => ...)
    Creates a hosted zone.

    "name" is the domain name this zone holds records for, e.g. 'test.com.'.

    "caller_reference" is some unique client-chosen (aka you) identifier.

    "comment" is, well, the comment used for zone creation.

    Only the "name" parameter is mandatory; suitable values will be
    generated for the other options if they are omitted.

    Returns the new hosted zone object if called in scalar context; the
    change and hosted zone objects if called in list context; that is:

        my ($hz, $change) = $r53->create_hosted_zone(...);
        my $hz            = $r53->create_hosted_zone(...);

    Dies on error. For more information, see the Route53 API and Developer's
    Guide.

  copy_hosted_zone($hz)
    Given a hosted zone object, create a new hosted zone and copy the
    contents of the given zone to the new zone.

    Returns the new hosted zone instance.

  delete_hosted_zone($hz_id)
    Delete a hosted zone, by its id; both the plain id (e.g.
    "ZIQB30DSWGWG6") or the full one Amazon returns (e.g.
    "/hostedzone/ZIQB30DSWGWG6") are acceptable ids.

    We do not perform any validation. If the zone doesn't exist, or is not
    pristine (contains any non-Amazon record sets), or anything else goes
    sideways, we'll just die.

  request($method, $uri_part, $content)
    Make a request to Route53.

  get_request
    Same as request(), but as a GET.

  post_request
    Same as request(), but as a POST.

  delete_request
    Same as request(), but as a DELETE.
